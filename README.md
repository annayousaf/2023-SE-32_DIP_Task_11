Lab Task 11
Prompt
Give a complete Python code for Google Colab that performs comprehensive morphological image processing operations. The code should begin by allowing the user to upload an image interactively, then convert it to a binary image using thresholding.  implement basic morphological operations including erosion and dilation, followed by compound operations like opening and closing. The script should also extract object boundaries by subtracting the eroded image from the original, fill holes in objects using morphological reconstruction with iterative dilation, and remove noise through morphological opening. Additionally, implement shape detection by finding contours, approximating polygons, and classifying shapes as triangles, rectangles, or circles based on vertex count. Finally, visualize all results — the original binary image, erosion, dilation, opening, closing, boundary extraction, hole-filled image, noise-removed image, and shape-detected image
